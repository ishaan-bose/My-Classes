# My-Classes
I will store all classes over here

Note to anyone who is collaborating: the functions of some of the class code
is there on my other repository , the "My-functions" repository

Note to anyone who is collaborating: like certain functions, the "int main()" functions are also
in another repository, the "My-c-main-function" repository.





Anyone who is collaborating can add their own classes.
Only thing to do while uploading/adding is to give a short but clear description for 
every variable and function. Or you can also name the variable such that its use 
is clear.


For example:
double degreesToRadians(int degrees){.....}

here the variable "degrees" is clear so you don't have to state its use
